This namespace is semi-blatant copy-paste of [GameHelper](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/mmo/path-of-exile/poe-bots-programs/953353-gamehelper-light-version-of-poehud-exile-api-351.html) code base with my own minor spin on it.
Saying that code base of GH helped to understand PoE internals is an understatement. It is extremely well-documented 
and I felt that reinventing the wheel would hurt considering level of expertise that is clearly noticeable in the codebase of GH.

This code will never-ever be covering as many aspects of the game as GH/ExileCore/PoeHUD do. 
It's primary role and responsibility is provide some data for EyeAuras behavior trees. 
There will be no radar or anything similar. 
Will probably add some cooldown-tracking, potion and, maybe, buff-tracking in the future. 

I thought about integration with GH using plugin and this could be the future approach.
